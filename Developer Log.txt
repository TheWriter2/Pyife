Day 1 (??):

Made the main.py file and added the Person and World classes, still experimenting with text output.

Day 2 (14/05/2025):

Text lines are now stored on the TextData class, and the rendering process is in the Rendering class,
this should allow me to abstract the rendering process into any context by just making different variations
of the Renderer class.
